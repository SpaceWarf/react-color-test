This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### The weird behavior

When you trying to select colors close to the bottom edge of the color picker, the selection is updated but does not represent the position of the mouse click.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
